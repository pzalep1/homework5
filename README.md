# Getting Started 
You will need a few things installed in order to attempt this homework:
1. Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
2. Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
3. A code editor of your choice. I recommend VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

# Cloning the Repo
After you have Git installed you will be able to run the following commands to clone this reposiotry onto your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pzalep1/homework5.git
```

# Installing Dependencies
Next you must install the necessary packages using Nodes package manager npm:
```bash 
npm install
```
# Viewing the Code and Starting the Server
Once it is on your machine and you have all of the packages you can open it in the text editor of your choice to view the code. 

To start the live development server run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
# Using the Application in the Browser
To test the application code you can navigate in any browser to http://localhost:3300. If you do not see a page like the image below ensure that you have followed all of the above steps.
